# Supabase Pause Prevention

Stop Supabase projects from pausing due to inactivity! :raised_hands:

> On the free-tier plan, projects that are inactive for more than 7 days are paused. 


## How it works

- Creating a _cron job_ (scheduled task) that makes a simple database call
  - _(This keeps your Supabase project active)_
- Fetching `keep-alive.ts` API endpoints for the other projects, as Vercel limits free-tier users to one cron job.

## Getting Started

**Super simple to add to your existing Supabase project!**

Only 3 files matter:

- [`/app/api/keep-alive/route.ts`](app/api/keep-alive/route.ts) - API endpoint the cron job will execute
- [`/config/keep-alive-config.ts`](app/api/keep-alive/route.ts) - Configuration for your setup
- [`/vercel.json`](app/api/keep-alive/route.ts) - Directs Vercel to periodically run the `keep-alive` endpoint

`utils/supabase` folder contains files provided in the Supabase docs for the [Next.js Web App demo â€” Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-nextjs)

Everything else is boilerplate from Next.js `create-next-app`

### Configuring your other Supabase projects

After selecting your primary project (the one that implements the code provided in this repository), you'll want to add an API endpoint to your other Supabase projects

The only requirement is that this endpoint is reachable and makes a call to your Supabase database

> [!NOTE]
> API endpoint must make database call
> Ensure the server doesn't cache this

<summary>Example of a setup using Prisma as an ORM</summary>

`/pages/api/keep-alive.ts` 

```typescript
// Next.js API route support: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
import { prisma } from 'src/server/db'
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export default async function handler(
  _req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  try {
    const dbResponse = await prisma.tag.findMany()
    const successMessage = (dbResponse != null && dbResponse?.length > 0) ? "Success" : "Fail"
    res.status(200).json(successMessage)
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(401).send("There was an error")
  }
}
```

### Sample response

Visiting `https://your-project-domain.vercel.app/api/keep-alive` 

```
Results for retrieving
'mzmgylpviofc' from 'keep-alive' at column 'name': []

Other Endpoint Results:
https://your-other-vercel-project-urls.vercel.app/api/keep-alive - Passed
https://your-other-supabase-app.com/api/keep-alive - Passed

```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
